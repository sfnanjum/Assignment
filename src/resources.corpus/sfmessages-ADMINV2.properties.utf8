#Edit Route Map
ADMINV2_ERM_HELP_STEP_NAME=The step name that will display on the route map within a form.
ADMINV2_ERM_HELP_SINGLE_STEP_TYPE=This is used when you don't want the form to be shared at this step with a group of people - only one single person. <br>Example: You just want the $(employee) to have an assigned action at this point in the process.
ADMINV2_ERM_HELP_STEP_TYPE_ITER=This allows multiple people to iterate back and forth before moving the form onto the next step. With the iterative step type, users will have a clear definition of who has the form in their inbox for editing and review, and who it will be routed to next. Unlike collaborative where the group gets the form all at the same time. <br>Example: You want the $(manager) and the $(employee) to be able to make edits and send back and forth to each other before routing to the next step.
ADMINV2_ERM_HELP_STEP_TYPE_COLAB=This allows multiple people to review and make edits to the form at the same time. With the collaborative step type, only one user can edit the form at a time; but unlike the iterative step type, the form is accessible in everyone's inbox. <br>Example: You want the $(manager), second level $(manager) and HR to be able to access the form for an executive review.
ADMINV2_ERM_HELP_ROLES=Roles are associated to $(employees) when you add them to the SuccessFactors system. The route map you are defining will use the roles assigned to these users to figure out who to send the process form to. There are standard system roles as defined below, but there is a  custom option if your needs are more advanced. Examples of custom codes include:  \n\
 R - Recruiter in Recruiting \n\
 W - Second recruiter in Recruiting \n\
 Q - VP of staffing in Recruiting \n\
 T - Primary coordinator in Recruiting \n\
 G - Hiring $(manager) in Recruiting \n\
 S - Sourcer in Recruiting \n\
 I F - Family expert (only valid in the signature stage)

ADMINV2_ERM_MODSTAGE_HELP_TXT=This is the stage in the process where users can review, update, and evaluate the content of a form.
ADMINV2_ERM_EVALSTAGE_HELP_TXT=This stage is specific to 360 reviews. This is where approved raters give their feedback on the subject of the review.
ADMINV2_ERM_SIGSTAGE_HELP_TXT=This is the stage in the process where all defined users sign form to approve or acknowledge the content of the form.
ADMINV2_ERM_COMPSTAGE_HELP_TXT=Once the last step in your route map has been recorded, this step serves as a final wrap up. The form will be moved into the respective user's completed inbox, notices of the completion will be sent out.
ADMINV2_ERM_360RMCB_HELP_TXT=Select if you want to use this workflow for 360 reviews. This will allow you to edit what your users see in the evaluation stage of a 360 review. The evaluation stage is where others enter their feedback about the individual being evaluated.
ADMINV2_ERM_RELATIVE_HELP_TXT=This option will allow you to enter # of days before or after (as appropriate) another step in your process versus selecting actual calendar dates.For example, in an Anniversary form you can choose a Due Date for the step to be 30 days after the Form Creation Date versus needing to identify an actual date.  Note that by selecting this option all of your route map dates will be relative.
ADMINV2_ERM_USERNOTAVAILCB_HELP_TXT=When you launch your process using this workflow, SuccessFactors will determine which users in the system should receive a copy of the form in their inbox based on the roles you have selected. If this option is selected, for any iterative or collaborative step you define, SuccessFactors will eliminate the step in the form creation process if the $(employee) does not have any one of those roles assigned to the $(employee). For example, if you defined a route map that said: $(Employee) reviews themselves -> $(Employees) $(Manager) and the HR Manager meet -> $(Manager) signs off. By checking this box, if a user does not have a HR manager instead of creating the step just for the $(manager) and having them route it to themselves, the step will be eliminated all together and go straight to the $(manager) for sign.
